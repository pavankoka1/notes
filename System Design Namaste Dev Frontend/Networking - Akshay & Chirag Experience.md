### Module: Networking
- Different aspects of networking, related to frontend.
- How frontend systems communicate to backend systems.
- How different systems communicate with each other.
- Networking is important and needs to be studied.
- They are excited to teach about networking and do justice to the audience.
- They will talk about fundamentals, but also something crazy.
- We need to understand networking.
- Need to understand people's perspectives.
### The Need for Inter-System Communication
- No system can exist in **isolation**.
- To build a complete application (web, frontend/backend, etc.), different systems **must connect and communicate**.
- Key questions:
- How do systems communicate?
- Are there specific **protocols** or **guidelines** for this communication?
### Importance of Networking
- Crucial in industry, large-scale applications, and when multiple engineers are working together.
- Provides guidelines and standards for flexibility and growth.
- **Web development**: Transition from static to dynamic content necessitates networking.
- If you want something dynamic, your networking starts.
### Networking for Web Development
- Networking starts as soon as you think about connecting to another system.
- Interaction with the backend is important, so is networking.
- Networking is not just for network engineers or backend engineers.
- You need to understand networking to think from a product perspective or to develop a web application.
### Networking for Dynamic Frontend
- When the frontend needs to do something dynamic, it requires data.
- To get this data, it needs to connect to a database and fetch data from there.
- Backend developers build APIs to facilitate this data retrieval.
- Networking is important for how data travels from a server to a client (e.g., web browser).
- Networking is what happens in between the server and the client.
- The module will cover how data reaches the client from the server.
- Topics include required protocols and different ways to transfer data.
### Networking Explained
- When a request leaves your system through the network, it eventually gives you something back.
- It's essential to understand the process in depth.
### Optimizing Application Speed
- Goal: Optimize each point to make the application faster.
- Speed is crucial in today's era.
- Providing the right set of experience.
### Understanding Protocols
- Common protocols include:
    - `HTTP`
    - `HTTPS`
    - `WebSocket`
    - `HTTP 1`, `2`, `3`
    - `TCP`
    - `UDP`
    - `FTP`
### REST APIs
- REST APIs are commonly used for frontends to get data.
- Most applications use REST APIs.
- Advanced Concepts:
- GraphQL: Became popular in recent times.
- gRPC: Quite underrated. People are talking about eras.
### Advanced Concepts
- **gRPC**: Becoming more adopted, especially in 2023 and moving forward.
- Key idea: *Write once*, and provide capability for direct execution from different programming languages.
- The module will cover communication protocols and the basics of how the web works.
- It will also discuss different strategies to follow in the communication layer.
- Past experience includes using **REST**, **GraphQL**, and **gRPC**.
- If you have used them, how does that matter?
### REST vs GraphQL
- GraphQL is not always the solution.
- In Microsoft, a project involved deprecating GraphQL and moving to REST.
- REST was used at a scale where it was more effective.
### REST Endpoints
- Can be used to interact with a database.
- Allows performing various operations on the client-side.
### GraphQL
- Useful for use cases like batching and managing relationships between different entities.
- Can eliminate the need for a middle layer in certain scenarios.
- Used in different teams at Microsoft.
- Used extensively at Flipkart.
### GraphQL Federation
- Used to stitch different systems together.
- Not just to build one system.
